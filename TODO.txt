WISH LIST
---------
  * Create Windows ".ico" versions of the icons in the "icons/" directory.

  * Joystick support.

  * Paddle support (simply a variation of joystick support)

  * Use a platform-independant settings-file library, so that Mad Bomber for
    Windows uses real Windows ".ini" files, and Mad Bomber for BeOS uses
    whatever BeOS uses.  (Ditto for Mac, when the SDL Mac port is finished.)

    (Is ANYONE going to write a ***-****ed library for this!?!?!)
